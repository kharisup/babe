			The business of the Bayan Group is strongly built on the strength of our experience in
			Indonesia. Our President Director and Founder of Bayan Group - Dato’ Dr. Low Tuck Kwong’s
			business interests commenced in Indonesia in 1973 when he formed PT. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia
			(JSI) as an earthworks, civil works and marine structure contractor. JSI quickly became
			pioneer in complex pile foundation works, and leading contractor in Indonesia in the above
			fields and remained so during the 1980’s and 1990’s. In 1988, JSI ventured into contract coal
			mining and was a leading mining contractor until 1998 when Dato’ Dr. Low acquired PT. Gunung
			Bayan Pratamacoal (GBP) and PT. Dermaga Perkasapratama (DPP). At the time GBP had not
			commenced mining and the Balikpapan Coal Terminal (under DPP) has a rated capacity of 2.5
			million tonnes per annum. Under the leadership of Dato’ Dr. Low, the Bayan Group quickly
			transformed into vertically integrated successful and reputed coal mining company. The Bayan
			Group was formed through number of strategic acquisitions in the coal sector and established
			with a proven track record in developing greenfield coal mines. In particular, in recent years
			the Tabang / Pakar project has expanded from being a small-scale mining operation producing
			only 1.9 million tonnes in 2014 to producing approximately 22.7 million tonnes in 2018. This
			has rapidly increased Bayan’s position in the market now placing it within the top 5
			Indonesian coal producers. Further growth is planned in coming years with a target to increase
			the Tabang / Pakar Project to production of approximately 50 million tonnes per annum. The
			Bayan Group is an innovator in the Indonesian coal mining industry and it is continuously
			looking at new methodologies and technologies to cement its position as one of the lowest cost
			producers in Indonesia. For example the Bayan Group was the first coal mining company in
			Indonesia to employ through-seam blasting at its Wahana mine, utilise the dozer-push mining
			methodologies at our Tabang mine and is currently utilising some of the largest coal haulage
			trucks in Indonesia with payloads of 200 to 220 tonnes. We expect this trend to continue as we
			evaluate other opportunities. The Bayan Group has some of the leading coal infrastructure in
			the country through its ownership of the Balikpapan Coal Terminal, the Perkasa and Wahana
			Jetties and the two Floating Transfer Barges (KFT’s). These facilities including the ability
			to unload barges, stockpile coal and load to vessels at speeds ranging from 3,000 to 8,000
			tonnes per hour. Certain of these facilities are also able to blend coal from multiples
			stockpiles and qualities. We continue to invest to expand these facilities where required
			providing our customers flexibility in the vessels they use as well as redundancy in terms of
			our capacity.
